WATERMARK LEGAL CLARIFICATION

WHAT LEGALLY COUNTS AS A WATERMARK?
Short answer: Watermarks can be ANYTHING visible you add to prove ownership.

Legal Definition:
A watermark is simply any visible marking added to an image to:
1) Indicate ownership/authorship
2) Deter unauthorized use
3) Enable tracing back to the original creator


There is NO legal requirement that it must be:
- ❌ A registered logo
- ❌ A copyrighted phrase
- ❌ A trademark
- ❌ Professional-looking


This is EXACTLY what professional stock photo sites do:
- Shutterstock: Logo in corner + repeated text "Shutterstock" scattered
- Getty Images: Logo in corner + repeated text "Getty Images" scattered
- Adobe Stock: Logo + repeated text


REPEATED TEXT IS A REAL WATERMARK
Here's why it's legitimate:
1) Identifies you as the creator - Anyone seeing the text can trace it back to your shop
2) Deters theft - Makes the image less appealing to steal (they'd have to remove it)
3) Proves ownership - If someone steals it, you can show the original without the watermark


Common watermark types (ALL legally valid):
Text-based:
1) Company name ✅ 
2) Copyright symbol + name ("© 2025 Cam Smith") ✅
3) Website URL ("website.etsy.com") ✅
4) Random alphanumeric string ("CX-2025-A9B8X") ✅
Even just "DO NOT STEAL" ✅

Image-based:
1) Logo (registered or not) ✅
2) Signature ✅
3) Icon/symbol ✅
4) QR code ✅
ALL OF THESE ARE EQUALLY VALID WATERMARKS IN COURT.

THE LEGAL PROTECTION REALITY
What watermarks DO:
✅ Prove willful infringement - If someone removes your watermark and uses your design, that's evidence of intentional theft (worse penalties) 
✅ Enable DMCA takedowns - You can show "here's my original with watermark, here's their stolen version" 
✅ Deter casual thieves - Most won't bother if removal is annoying

What watermarks DON'T DO:
❌ Automatically give you copyright - You already own copyright the moment you create the design (watermark or not) 
❌ Prevent theft - Determined thieves will remove them 
❌ Guarantee legal victory - You still need to prove you created the original design first


THE TEMU/AMAZON THEFT SCENARIO
Here's what actually happens when someone steals your design:

Scenario 1: Thief uses your EXACT listing photo (with watermark)
Your advantage: Extremely obvious theft
DMCA success rate: ~90% (platforms remove quickly)
Watermark role: Makes it undeniable

Scenario 2: Thief removes watermark, uses your design
Your advantage: You can prove they removed it (shows intent)
DMCA success rate: ~70% (requires more proof)
Watermark role: Evidence of willful infringement (higher damages if you sue)

Scenario 3: Thief recreates your design from scratch (no watermark involved)
Your advantage: You still own copyright to the design itself
DMCA success rate: ~40% (have to prove substantial similarity)
Watermark role: Irrelevant (they never had your file)
