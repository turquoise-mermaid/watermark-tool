PACKAGING GUIDE FOR WINDOWS DISTRIBUTION
=========================================

This guide explains how to package the Python tool as a Windows .exe file
that your Fiverr testers and customers can run.


PREREQUISITES
-------------
You need:
1. A Windows machine OR a Windows virtual machine/cloud instance
2. Python 3.8+ installed
3. The watermark_tool folder with all files


PACKAGING STEPS
===============

STEP 1: Install PyInstaller
----------------------------
Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and run:

    pip install pyinstaller


STEP 2: Navigate to Project Folder
-----------------------------------
    cd C:\path\to\watermark_tool


STEP 3: Create the Executable
------------------------------
Run this command:

    pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name "WatermarkTool" ^
                --add-data "config.json;." ^
                --icon=icon.ico ^
                watermark_tool.py

OR if you don't have an icon file, use this simpler version:

    pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name "WatermarkTool" watermark_tool.py

Explanation of flags:
- --onefile: Creates single .exe file (easier distribution)
- --windowed: Hides console window (cleaner for users)
- --name: Output filename
- --add-data: Includes additional files (optional)
- --icon: Custom icon (optional, requires .ico file)


STEP 4: Find Your Executable
-----------------------------
After PyInstaller completes (takes 1-2 minutes):

    watermark_tool/
    └── dist/
        └── WatermarkTool.exe  ← This is your distributable file!


STEP 5: Test the Executable
----------------------------
1. Navigate to the dist/ folder
2. Double-click WatermarkTool.exe
3. Verify it launches and works correctly
4. Test all features before distribution


CREATING THE DISTRIBUTION PACKAGE
==================================

STEP 6: Create Distribution Folder
-----------------------------------
Create a new folder called: watermark_tool_v1.0

Copy these files into it:
    watermark_tool_v1.0/
    ├── WatermarkTool.exe       (from dist/)
    ├── README.txt              (user documentation)
    ├── LICENSE.txt             (license agreement)
    └── example_logo.png        (optional: sample logo for testing)


STEP 7: Create ZIP Archive
---------------------------
1. Right-click the watermark_tool_v1.0 folder
2. Select "Send to" → "Compressed (zipped) folder"
3. Rename to: watermark_tool_v1.0.zip


STEP 8: Upload to Gumroad
--------------------------
1. Go to gumroad.com
2. Create new product
3. Upload watermark_tool_v1.0.zip
4. Set price: $27
5. Add product description (see MARKETING_COPY.txt)


TROUBLESHOOTING PYINSTALLER
============================

Issue: "ModuleNotFoundError" when running .exe
Solution: Install missing module and rebuild:
    pip install [missing_module]
    pyinstaller --onefile --windowed watermark_tool.py

Issue: .exe is too large (>100MB)
Solution: Use virtual environment to reduce dependencies:
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install pyinstaller
    pyinstaller --onefile --windowed watermark_tool.py

Issue: Antivirus flags .exe as suspicious
Solution: This is common with PyInstaller. Solutions:
    - Code-sign the executable (requires certificate ~$100/year)
    - Upload to VirusTotal and share results with users
    - Include hash (SHA256) in documentation for verification
    - Warn users in README that antivirus may flag it

Issue: tkinter file dialogs don't work in .exe
Solution: Should work with current build. If not, try:
    pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --collect-all tkinter watermark_tool.py


ALTERNATIVE: BUILD ON LINUX FOR WINDOWS
========================================

If you ONLY have Linux (no Windows access), you can use Wine + PyInstaller:

STEP 1: Install Wine
    sudo apt install wine wine32 wine64

STEP 2: Install Python in Wine
    wine python-3.9.0.exe  (download Windows Python installer first)

STEP 3: Install PyInstaller in Wine
    wine pip install pyinstaller

STEP 4: Build
    wine pyinstaller --onefile --windowed watermark_tool.py

⚠️ WARNING: This method is less reliable. Strongly recommend using
actual Windows machine or cloud Windows instance for packaging.


CLOUD WINDOWS INSTANCE OPTIONS
===============================

If you don't have Windows, rent a cloud instance for 1-2 hours:

Option 1: AWS EC2 Windows
- Cost: ~$0.50/hour
- Setup: 10 minutes
- Good for: One-time packaging

Option 2: Azure Virtual Desktop
- Cost: ~$0.40/hour
- Setup: 15 minutes
- Good for: Testing + packaging

Option 3: Paperspace
- Cost: ~$0.50/hour
- Setup: 5 minutes
- Good for: Quick builds

Steps for cloud instance:
1. Launch Windows instance
2. Connect via RDP
3. Install Python + Git
4. Clone your GitHub repo
5. Run PyInstaller commands
6. Download the .exe via RDP
7. Terminate instance


FIVERR TESTER SETUP
===================

When sending to Fiverr testers, provide:

Package Contents:
    watermark_tool_v1.0.zip (containing):
    ├── WatermarkTool.exe
    ├── README.txt
    ├── QA_TESTING_CHECKLIST.txt
    └── test_images/ (folder with 20+ sample images)

Instructions for Testers:
1. Extract ZIP to Desktop
2. Double-click WatermarkTool.exe
3. Follow QA_TESTING_CHECKLIST.txt
4. Report results via email

Tester Compensation:
- Suggest: $25-40 per thorough test
- Should take 2-3 hours to complete checklist
- Require: Completed checklist + screenshots + samples


POST-RELEASE UPDATES
====================

For version updates (v1.1, v1.2, etc.):

1. Update version number in code:
    print("ETSY WATERMARK PROTECTION TOOL v1.1")

2. Update README.txt with changelog

3. Rebuild with PyInstaller

4. Upload new ZIP to Gumroad

5. Email existing customers with free update link


SECURITY BEST PRACTICES
========================

Before distributing:
[ ] Remove any hardcoded credentials/API keys
[ ] Test on fresh Windows machine
[ ] Verify no personal data in config files
[ ] Run antivirus scan on final .exe
[ ] Generate SHA256 hash for verification
[ ] Consider code-signing (optional, costs money)

To generate SHA256 hash (Windows):
    certutil -hashfile WatermarkTool.exe SHA256

Include this hash in your README for users to verify authenticity.


FILE SIZE EXPECTATIONS
======================

Expected .exe size: 15-30MB
(Includes Python interpreter + all libraries)

If larger than 50MB, something is wrong. Check:
- Unnecessary dependencies included
- Large data files bundled accidentally
- Multiple Python installations detected


DISTRIBUTION CHECKLIST
======================

Before uploading to Gumroad:
[ ] Tested .exe on Windows 10
[ ] Tested .exe on Windows 11
[ ] All features working
[ ] No console window appears (if using --windowed)
[ ] File dialogs open correctly

[ ] README.txt is clear and helpful
[ ] LICENSE.txt included
[ ] QA_TESTING_CHECKLIST.txt prepared for testers
[ ] Example images included for testing
