❓ FAQ

Q: Will this prevent ALL theft?
A: No watermark is 100% theft-proof. This makes removal annoying
   enough that thieves target easier prey. You also get invisible
   metadata for legal proof of ownership.

Q: Will watermarks hurt my sales on Etsy?
A: Many successful sellers use watermarks despite Etsy's guidance.
   Adjustable opacity (10-40%) lets you balance protection vs.
   appearance. Test what works for your shop.

Q: Do I need a logo?
A: Nope! Text-only watermarks are very effective. Shop name or
   "© 2025 Your Name" works great.

Q: Can I watermark hundreds of images?
A: Yes! Batch processing handles unlimited images. Process your
   entire catalog in one session.

Q: What formats are supported?
A: PNG, JPG, JPEG, WEBP (input and output)

Q: Does it work on Mac/Linux?
A: Yes, if you have Python installed. Windows users get .exe file.

Q: How long does watermarking take?
A: ~1-2 seconds per image. 100 images = 2-3 minutes.

Q: Can I try before buying?
A: No free trial, but 30-day money-back guarantee if it doesn't
   work on your system.
