TEXT WATERMARKS
- Custom text (shop name, copyright notice, etc.)
- Multiple scattered instances (default: 7)
- Density-weighted placement (more in center, fewer at edges)

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------
- Windows 10 or later / Linux / macOS

- Your logo file (optional, PNG recommended)


RECOMMENDED SETTINGS
--------------------
For most Etsy/POD sellers:
- Watermark count: 7

- Text: Your shop name or "© 2025 Your Name"


FILE FORMATS SUPPORTED
----------------------
Input: PNG, JPG, JPEG, WEBP
Output: Same format as input
Templates: JSON


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

"Logo file appears corrupted"
→ Try a different PNG file or skip logo and use text only

"No images found in folder"
→ Make sure your folder contains PNG, JPG, JPEG, or WEBP files

"Permission denied when saving"
→ Choose a different output folder where you have write access

"Progress bar stuck"
→ Large images take longer - wait for completion

"Template file corrupted"
→ Tool will automatically create fresh config - your templates may be lost


TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS
----------------------
1. Use PNG logos with transparent backgrounds
2. Test on 2-3 images first to check appearance
3. Higher opacity (40%) for light/white backgrounds
4. Lower opacity (10-20%) for dark/busy designs
5. More watermarks (10+) for high-value designs
6. Export your templates as backup files


PRIVACY & SECURITY
------------------
- All processing happens locally on your computer
- No internet connection required
- No data sent to external servers
- Your images never leave your machine


LEGAL NOTE
----------
Watermarks deter theft but cannot prevent determined thieves.
This tool provides:
- Visible deterrent (makes removal annoying)
- Legal proof of ownership (embedded metadata)
- DMCA takedown support (traceable watermarks)

No watermark is 100% removal-proof. The goal is to make your
designs annoying enough to steal that thieves target easier prey.
